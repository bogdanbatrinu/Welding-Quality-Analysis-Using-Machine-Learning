# Welding-Quality-Analysis-Using-Machine-Learning
This project focuses on developing a Python-based tool to predict welding defects based on various input parameters such as welding speed, material properties, and environmental factors.

## Running the Web Application

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Train the model and generate required files:
   ```bash
   python welding_quality.py
   ```
3. Launch the Flask app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   Visit `http://localhost:8080` in your browser to make predictions or retrain the model from the web interface.
